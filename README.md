# bookCompiler

## Purpose

The purpose of this app is to help you compile all your thoughts after reading books. Often times you will read something and not benefit enough from it because you didn't summarize all the concepts and ideas from the texts. The goal of this project is to give you a space to store your book compilations and make the compilation process more efficient and structured.
